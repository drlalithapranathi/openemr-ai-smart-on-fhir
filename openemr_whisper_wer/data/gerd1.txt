Good morning. Please come in and have a seat. What brings you in today? Morning Doctor, I've been vomiting a lot lately. I can barely keep any food down. I see. How long has this been happening? It started a few weeks ago. At first it was just nausea now and then. But now I vomit almost every day. And when you vomit do you notice anything unusual? Blood, unusual color or undigested food? No, no blood. Just food and some stomach fluid. How about pain? Do you feel anything when vomiting or after meals? Yes, I get this burning pain in my upper chest and stomach. It's worse after meals. Yeah, any trouble swelling? Like food getting stuck? Sometimes it feels a little tight going down. And if fever, chills or recent weight changes beside what you mentioned? No fever. I lost some weight but I thought it was from not eating much because of the vomiting. That makes sense. Can you tell me about your typical meals? Do certain foods make it worse? Okay. I can barely eat but fatty or heavy meals seem to trigger it more so I have been trying to avoid fatty or heavy meals since few days. Okay, let's talk about your medications. Can you tell me what you take daily for your diabetes, blood pressure and or any other conditions? Yeah, so I do have diabetes and I have blood pressure. I take pills for both diabetes and my blood pressure. I think one of my medicines was changed recently but I am not sure which one. That's helpful. Have you recently started any injections or new treatments? I don't really remember maybe something my old doctor mentioned. Alright I'll check your records to be sure. Okay. Yeah I see that you have recently started on a weekly injection for your diabetes and the dose was increased about a month ago. Oh yes, I think I remember the nose getting me an injection. That medication can help with diabetes and weight, But in some patients it slows down stoma caffeine which can cause nausea and vomiting. In rare cases repeated vomiting can injure the esophagus and cause severe reflex or ulcers. Oh I had no idea I could do that. No one told me it might cause this much trouble. It's an uncommon complication but it can happen. Especially if vomiting is persistent. Since you have had this for a few weeks, I would like to do some tests to check your ESO figures. What kind of tests? The main one is an endoscopy. It's a procedure where we look at your isophagus and stomach with a small camera to see if there are ulcers or other damage. I'll also start medication to reduce stomach acid and protect your isophagus. Oh yeah, that sounds good. But will it heal? Most people recover well with treatment. We will also cause the injection for now and monitor your blood sugar with other medication that don't cause these side effects. Okay but and for my diabetes is safe to stop the injection? Yes, we will adjust your oral medications and monitor you closely. Once you are stomach and esophagus have healed, we can decide the safest long term plan for your diabetes. I am worried could this get worse if it is not treated quickly? Yes, persistent vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances or even bleeding from the hisophagus. That's why we want to start treatment promptly. Oh yeah, I understand. Is there anything I can do at home to feel better while waiting? Eat small frequent meals, avoid lying down right after eating and stick to soft or bland foods. Drink plenty of water but in small sips, avoid very fatty, spicy or acidic foods until we see the results. Also, we will schedule a follow-up after the end is copy. If you notice blood in your vomit, severe pain or worsening vomiting, go to the emergency room immediately. I will doctor, thank you for explaining everything, thank you very much. You're welcome. We'll get the test done soon and work together to manage your diabetes safely while taking care of your stomach.
