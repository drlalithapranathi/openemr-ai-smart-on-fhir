Hello there, I am Dr. Lee. I hear you haven't been feeling well. Can you tell me what's been happening? Hi Dr. Yeah, my stomach hurts and I've been throwing up since yesterday. I just feel awful. I'm sorry you're feeling so poorly. When did the symptoms start? Yesterday morning, first step had nauseous, then I started vomiting. Since then I've been so thirsty drinking water constantly. Oh and how are you feeling right now? We can tired. My parents say I've been a bit out of it today. Oh okay I see you've got type-on diabetes diagnosed about two years ago. Have you been taking your insulin in a situation? Normally yes but now two days ago and couldn't get a refill. Thanks for being honest, it's really important. Skipping insulin can be dangerous, have you checked your blood sugar at home? No, I didn't have any strips left. Oh alright, have your rotors fever for any other signs of infection? No, it's just tummy pain as vomiting. Ok, let me examine you. You are hard to eat as fast and your blood pressure is a bit low and your breathing deeply and quickly. I also notice a fruity smell on your breath. I think this is typical when the body produces ketones. Is that dangerous? It can be based on your symptoms and what I see. I am concerned you are in diabetic ketoacidosis. That means your body doesn't have enough insulin, so it's burning fat for fuel, or producing acid's cicatones that explains your stomach pain nausea and the deep breathing. Is it because I missed insulin? Exactly. Missing insulin is one of the most common causes. Sometimes infections are certain medications can also trigger it but in your case it looks like your insulin or mission cost. That sound serious. It is but the good news is we can treat it effectively if you act quickly so we're already I think they're already run some blood tests. Your glucose is very high at about 450 and your blood is acidic with a pH of 7.24. I think that confirms the diagnosis. What happens now? First, let me give you some eye-u-fluids to correct your dehydration. Then we'll give you insulin to a drip to study, bring your sugar down and stop the ketone production. Okay. Okay. One thing to understand is potassium. Even though your blood test shows it's high, your body's total potassium is actually low because you have lost a lot in urine. Once we give insulin, potassium shifts back into your cells and your blood level can drop dangerously, so we'll monitor it closely and give you potassium if it falls. Wow, that sounds complicated. It can be, but we'll watch you very carefully. Don't worry about it and we will check your sugar every hour and your electrolytes and blood gases regularly. Do I have to stay in the hospital? Yes you will be admitted usually I think for 24 to 40 hours 48 hours should be good and once your stable will switch you back to injections instead of the drip. I just have one question if I take insulin, then it won't happen again. Um, that's right. The best prevention is taking your insulin every day. Um, we'll connect you with our diabetes, educator to help you plan ahead and avoid any caps in medication. What if I get sick, like with with the flu can this happen again? Good question. Yes, unless can trigger the diagnosis which we did for ketosidosis, even if you're taking your insulin, but that's why the give sick day rules for people with diabetes never stop insulin, check sugars more often, stay hydrated and see help early vomiting or unable to eat. Will this affect me in long term? If treated promptly, most people recover fully without long term damage, but if untreated it can be very life threatening. Because it can affect the brain and heart, that's why it's so important to came and when you did. There's a leaf to here. So here's the plan. We'll start, I will throw it and insulin right away. And monitor you closely. Once you're better, we'll restart your regular insulin injections and review your diabetes care. Okay, Doctor. Thank you for explaining everything. Your very verbal take good care of your and we will also make sure you leave with the clear plan for your insulin and debit is management. Bye.
