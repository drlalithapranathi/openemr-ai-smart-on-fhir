Good morning Mr Sharma, how are you feeling today? Morning doctor, I have been having a bad cough and shortness of breath these past few days. I am sorry to hear that. Can you tell me how long this has been happening? It started about 3 days ago with a runny nose and now I am coughing more and feeling tired when I walk around. I see, is the cup producing any flam or mucus? Yes, it's white and kind of thick. I usually have it in the mornings, but lately it's worse. About how much flam are you bringing up in a day? Would you say it's just a little or quite a bit? I'd say quite a bit, especially after I wake up. I had to cup for several minutes before I can breathe normally. Does the colour ever change? Maybe yellow or green or has it stayed white? Mostly white, maybe a little yellow when I got cold like this time. And you noticed any blood when you cup? No never any fever, chills or chest pain? No none of these just the cuff and trouble breathing. Happy ever had similar problems before? Yeah I have been getting this cuff on and off for years and sometimes my breathing makes a little whistling noise. Okay. Do you smoke my sherma? Yes, I've been smoking since my twenties around back and half a day, sometimes too. So that would be, let's see, close to 40 years of smoking. That's quite a long history of smoking. Yes, about that long. I've tried cutting down, but I haven't quit completely. I understand. It's not easy. Do you notice that your cuff gets worse after smoking or when you wake up? Oh yes, mornings are the worst. I can barely get through my first cup of coffee without coughing. That's pretty common in people with chronic bronchitis, which is one form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The smoke irritates your airways and over time the lungs produce extra mucus and become less efficient at moving air in and out. That makes sense. I do feel like I'm always short on breath, especially going upstairs. Oh I see. It's possible that your symptoms are early signs of COPD, but we'll need to confirm that. There are a few other lung conditions that can cause similar symptoms. So I'd like to run some tests to be sure. What kind of tests? First, I'd like to perform a spirometry test. You'll take a deep breath and blow forcefully into a tube connected to a small machine. It measures how much air your lungs can hold and how quickly you can breathe out. This helps us see if your airways are narrowed. Okay, does it hurt? Not at all. It's completely painless and takes just a few minutes. We'll also do a pulse oximetry test which is a small clip on your finger to check your oxygen levels. Depending on what we see, I might recommend a chest x-ray to rule out infections or other causes like asthma or heart related problems. Alright. Based on your history and the chronic cough, there's a possibility that you're developing COPD, but we can only diagnose that once the pyreometric concerns airflow limitation. I see. So what happens in the meantime? While we wait for the test results, I'd like you to start on a short arcing bronchodilator inhaler. It helps open your airways and should make breathing easier, especially when you're active or cupping a lot. Will I need to use it every day for now? Only when you feel short of breath or having coughing fits. If the test later confirms your PD or chronic bronchitis, will plan a long-term treatment that might include daily inhalers or other medications. Okay, that sounds reasonable. The most important thing right now is to cut down on smoking and ideally quit altogether. It's the single most effective step to prevent further lung damage. I have tried quitting before but it's really tough. I understand it's not easy. We can help you with nicotine patches, medications and counseling programs that make it easier. Even reducing your cigarette count will start helping your lungs. I'll try again. That's great. Also try to stay hydrated. It helps lose in the mucus and avoid outdoor pollution or strong orders that can irritate your lungs. Got it? Should I avoid exercise for now? Light activity like walking is fine as long as you don't push yourself too hard. Once your test results are back, we can discuss a pulmonary rehabilitation plan, a supervised exercise and breathing program that strengthens your lungs safely. Okay, that sounds good. Excellent. I'll also check your oxygen levels today and if needed, we might consider oxygen therapy later. But that depends entirely on your test results. Alright. So we'll confirm the diagnosis only after the spirometry and imaging test. In the meantime, use the inhaler as needed, drink plenty of fluids and avoid irritants. Thank you, doctor. You explained everything so clearly. You're welcome, Ms. Sharma. I'll have the nurse perform the spirometry now, and we'll schedule your follow-up visit in one week to go over the results. Sounds good. Thanks again. Take care and I'll see you soon.
