Hello there, I'm Dr. Lee. I hear you haven't been feeling well, can you tell me what's been happening?
Hi Dr. Yeah, my name is Toma Kurtz and I've been throwing up since yesterday. I just feel awful.
I'm sorry you're feeling so poorly, when did the symptoms start?
Yesterday morning, first I've had nauseous, then I started vomiting. Since then I've been so thirsty drinking water constantly.
Oh, and how are you feeling right now?
We can tired. My parents say I've been a bit out of it today.
Okay, I see you've got type 1 diabetes diagnosed about 2 years ago. Have you been taking your insulin energy usual?
Normally yes, but I ran out 2 days ago and couldn't get as you feel.
Thanks for being honest, that's really important.
Skipping insulin can be dangerous. Have you checked your blood sugar at home?
No, I didn't have any stiff sweat.
Oh, alright. Have you noticed fever for any other signs of infection?
No, it's just stomach pain and vomiting.
Okay, let me examine you.
Your heart rate is fast and your blood pressure is a bit low and you're breathing deeply and quickly.
I also notice a fruity smell on your breath.
I think this is typical when the body produces ketones.
Is that dangerous?
It can be based on your symptoms and what I see.
I'm concerned you're in diabetic ketoacidosis.
That means your body doesn't have enough insulin so it's burning fat for fuel or producing acid called ketones.
That explains your stomach pain nausea and the deep breathing.
Is it because I missed insulin?
Oh, exactly. Missing insulin is one of the most common causes.
Sometimes infections or certain medications can also trigger it.
But in your case, it looks like your insulin emission caused it.
That sounds serious.
It is, but the good news is we can treat it effectively if we act quickly.
So we are already, I think we have already run some blood tests.
Your glucose is very high at about 450 and your blood is acidic with a pH of 7.24.
I think that confirms the diagnosis.
What happens now?
First, let me give you some IU fluids to correct your dehydration.
Then we'll give you insulin through a drip to study,
bring your sugar down and stop the ketone production.
One thing to understand is potassium.
Even though your blood test shows it's high, your body's total potassium is actually low
because you have lost a lot in urine.
Once we give insulin, potassium shifts back into your cells and your blood level can drop dangerously.
So we'll monitor it closely and give you potassium if it falls.
Wow, that sounds complicated.
It can be, but we'll watch you very carefully, don't worry about it.
And we'll check your sugar every hour and your electrolytes and blood gases regularly.
Do I have to stay in the hospital?
Yes, you'll be admitted.
Usually I think for 24 to 48 hours should be good.
And once your stable will switch you back to injections instead of the drip.
I just have one question.
If I take my insulin, then it won't happen again.
That's right, the best prevention is taking your insulin every day.
We'll connect you with our diabetes educator to help you plan ahead and avoid any gaps in medication.
What if I get sick, like with the flu? Can this happen again?
Good question.
Yes, unless can trigger the diagnosis which we did for ketoacidosis, even if you're taking your insulin,
but that's why we give sick day rules for people with diabetes.
Never stop insulin, check sugars more often, stay hydrated and see help early formatting or unable to eat.
Will this affect me in long-term?
If treated promptly, most people recover fully without long-term damage.
But if I'm treated, it can be very life-threatening.
Or because it can affect the brain and heart, that's why it's so important you came in when you did.
That's a relief to you.
So here's the plan. We'll start IV fluids and insulin right away and monitor you closely.
What's your better? We'll restart your regular insulin injections and review your diabetes care.
Okay, Dr. Thank you for explaining everything.
You're welcome. We'll take good care of you and we'll also make sure you leave with a clear plan for your insulin and diabetes management. Bye.
