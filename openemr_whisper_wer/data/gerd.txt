Good morning, please come in and have a seat. What brings you in today? Morning Doctor, I've been vomiting a lot lately. I can barely keep any food down. I see how long has this been happening? It started a few weeks ago. At first it was just nausea. Now and then then but now I warm it almost every day. And when you warm it, do you notice anything unusual, blood, unusual colour or undigested food? No, no blood. Just food and stomach fluid. How about pain? Do you feel anything when vomiting after meals? Yes, I did this bony pain in my upper chest and stomach. It's worse after meals. Yeah, any trouble, swelling? Like food, getting stuck. Sometimes it feels a little tight going down. And if you will, chills or recent weight changes beside what you mentioned? No fever. A rossian weight, but I thought it was from not eating much because of the vomiting. That makes sense. Can you tell me about your typical meals? Do certain foods make it worse? Okay. I can barely eat but fatty or heavy meals into triggered more so I have been trying to avoid fatty or heavy meals since few days. Okay, let's talk about medications. Can you tell me what you take daily for your diabetes blood pressure and or any other conditions? Yeah, so I do have diabetes and I have blood pressure. I take pills for both diabetes and my blood pressure. I think one of my medicines was changed recently but I'm not sure which one. That's helpful. Have you recently started any injections or new treatments? I don't really remember maybe something my old doctor mentioned. Alright, I'll check your records to be sure. Okay. Yeah, I see that you are recently started on a weekly injection for your diabetes. And the dose was increased about a month. Oh yes. I think I remember the nurse getting me an injection. That medication can help with diabetes and weight. But in some patients, it slows down stomach emptying, which can cause nausea and weight. But in some patients it slows down stomach emptying which can cause nausea and vomiting. In real cases repeated vomiting can injure the isophagus and cause severe reflux or ulcers. Oh I had no idid for do that. No one told me it might cause this much trouble. It's an uncommon complication, but it can happen. Especially if vomiting is persistent. Since you have had this for a few weeks, I would like to do some tests to check your ease of figures. What kind of test? The main one is an endoscope. It's a procedure where we look at your ease of figures and stomach with a small camera to see if there are ulcers or other damage. I'll also start medication to reduce stomach acid and protect your ease of figures. Oh yeah, that sounds good. But will it heal? Most people recover where with treatment will also cause the injection for now and monitor your blood sugar with other medication that don't cause these side effects. Okay but and for my diabetes is safe to stop the injection? Yes, we will adjust your oval medications and monitor you closely. Once your stomach and is of a gas have healed, we can decide the safest long term plan for your diabetes. I am worried could this get worse if it is not treated quickly? Yes. Persistent vomiting can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, or even bleeding from the hesophagus. That's why we want to start treatment promptly. Oh yeah, I understand. Is there anything I can do at home to feel by door while waiting? Eat small, frequent meals avoid lying down right after eating and stick to soft or blind foods. Drink plenty of water but in small sips avoid very fatty, icy or acidic foods until we see the results. You know okay I'll try that. Also will schedule a follow up after the endscopy. If you notice blood in your vomit, severe pain or worsening vomiting, go to the emergency room immediately. I will doctor, thank you for explaining everything, thank you very much. You're welcome. We'll get the test done soon and work together to manage your diabetes safely while taking care of your stomach.
