Good morning, please come and take a seat. What brings you in today? Morning Doctor, I've been having the CV or pain in the upper right part of my stomach. Oh, okay. Can you point exactly to where you feel the pain? Around here, just under my ribs. Oh, okay, got it. And how long have you been experiencing this? Spin on and off for a few months, but in the past when the pain has become more frequent and much stronger. When the pain comes, how would you describe it? Is it like sharp, dull or calm like? Feels like a stabbing pain, sometimes like a tight squeeze, and it radiates to my back at times. That's helpful. Okay, so on a scale of 1 to 10, how bad is it at its worst? Around 9, it's almost unbeatable. Oh, I can imagine that must be very uncomfortable. Have you noticed whether anything triggers it or makes it worse? Yes, definitely after meals, especially if the food is oily or heavy. Oh, oh, you're heavy. Okay, got it. So does anything? Okay, so does anything relieve the pain? Not really. I've tried some over-the-counter tablets for gastric upset, but they don't seem to help. Hmm, understood. So have you had nausea nausea, vomiting or fever with these episodes? No fever. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, but I haven't vomited. Okay, about it. So let me ask you. Have you noticed any change in your bubble habits or has your urine turned darker than you should? any change in your bubble habits or has your urine turned darker than usual? Now that you mention it, my urine has looked darker lately. I thought it was just because I was drinking in a water. Mmm. Mmm. Oh. Hmm, oh. Okay, so while we are talking, I'm noticing a slight. Oh, yellowish, change in your eyes. Have you noticed that yourself? No, Doctor. I didn't pay attention. But looking now, yes yes I can see it. Oh that's a mild sign of jaundice. It can happen if a gall stone is blocking the bile flow from the liver. Oh I see I don't know that. Okay many people think stomach pain after eating is just cashed right as, but cashed right as pain is usually in the upper middle part of the abdomen. More like a burning sensation and often improves with some antacids. Your pain isn't the upper right side radiating to the back. Words of the fatting use as you mentioned and you have got some jaundice all of which point more to what girls don't rather than gas try it is. That makes sense now is it very serious? Mmm, girls' twins can cause complications of fun treat like infection of the car driver, the droplet of the bile ducts. But the good news is if you diagnose it early, it's very treatable. Will I need surgery? If car stones are confirmed and your symptoms are severe, the usual treatment is to remove the Galblad as surgically It's a common procedure and most people recover well But first we need to confirm the diagnosis Okay I'll order an abdominal ultrasound Which is the best Test related constants along with that. I want you to get some black dust, like liver function test, to check how you're really worth working and a cholesterol profile, since the consoles are offering you with cholesterol imbalance. - All right, Dr. - Before we finish, I want to check your records. I see you have hypertension. So, are you on medication and how is it controlled? Yes, I am on medication and my blood pressure is stable. Oh, good, good. So, do you drink alcohol? I used to drink heavily, but these days I still drank often, but not as much as before. Thank you for being honest. Alcohol can strain the liver so it's best to cut it out or cut it down further especially with this symptoms. I understand. I'll work on that. Great. I also do a quick abdominal examination now. Bye. Oh, okay, so I can feel some tenderness in the upper right quadrant which matches with your symptoms. The free enforce is my suspicion of calls from us. Okay. For now, I would say avoid fatty, fried and oily foods. They trigger wild blood on fractions and worsen the pain. And I think you should stay hydrated and risk of pain becomes unbearable or if you develop fever, chills or vomiting, you should come to the emergency room immediately. I will doctor. Thank you. You're welcome. Let's get those tests done and once we have the results we'll discuss the next steps together.
