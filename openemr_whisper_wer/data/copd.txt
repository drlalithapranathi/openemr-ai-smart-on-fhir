Good morning, Misharma. How are you feeling today? Morning, doctor. I have been having a bad cough and shortness of breath these past few days. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me how long this has been happening? It started about three days ago with the runny nose and now I'm cuffing more and feeling tired when I walk around. I see. Is the cup producing any flam or mucus? Yes, it's white and kind of thick. I usually have it in the mornings but lately it's worse. About how much flam are you bringing up in a day? Would you say it's just a little or quite a bit? I'd say quite a bit, especially after I wake up. I had to cook for several minutes before I can breathe normally. Does the color ever change may be yellow or green or has it stayed white? Mostly white may be a little yellow when I got cold like this time. And have you noticed any blood when you cup? No, never. Any fever, chills or just pain? No, none of these. Just the cup and trouble breathing. Have you ever had similar problems before? Yeah, I have been getting this cup honored of for years and sometimes my breathing makes a little whistling noise. Okay. Do you smoke micharla? Yes, I've been smoking since my 20s around 5.5 a day, sometimes too. So that would be, let's see, close to 40 years of smoking. That's quite a long history of smoking. Yes, about that long. I have tried cutting down, but I haven't quit completely. I understand. It's not easy. Do you notice that your cuff gets worse after smoking or when you wake up? Oh yes, mornings are the worst. I can barely get through my first cup of coffee without coughing. That's pretty common in people with chronic bronchitis, which is one form of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This smoke rotates your air waste and over time the lungs produce extra mucus and become less efficient at moving air in and out. That makes sense. I do feel like I am always short on breath especially going upstairs. Oh, I see. It is possible that your symptoms are early signs of CO PD, but we need to confirm that there are a few other lung conditions that can cause similar symptoms. So, I would like to run some tests to be sure. What kind of tests? First, I'd like to perform a spirometry test. You'll take a deep breath and blow forcefully into a tube connected to a small machine. It measures how much air your lungs can hold and how quickly you can breathe out. This helps as see if your airways are narrowed. Okay, does it hurt? Not at all. It's completely painless and takes just a few minutes. We'll also do a pulse oximetry test which is a small clip on your finger to check your oxygen levels. Depending on what we see, I might recommend a chest x-ray to rule out infections or other causes like asthma or heart related problems. Alright based on your history and the chronic cuff there is a possibility that you are developing COPD but we can only diagnose that once a spirebometry confirms airflow limitation. I see. So what happens in mean time? While we wait for the test results, I'd like you to start on a short acting bronchodilator inhaler. It helps open your airways and should make breathing easier, especially when your active work of a lot We will need to use it every day for now, only when you feel short of breath or having cupping fits. If the test later confirms COPD or chronic bronchitis, we plan a long-term treatment that might include daily inhalers or other medications. Okay, that sounds reasonable. The most important thing right now is to cut down on smoking and ideally quit altogether. It's the single most effective step to prevent further lung damage. I have tried quitting before, but it's really tough. I understand it's not easy. We can help you with nicotine patches, medications and counseling programs that make it easier. Even reducing your cigarette count will start helping you a lump. I'll try again. That's great. Also, try to stay hydrated. It helps losing the mucus and avoid outdoor pollution or strong orders that can irritate your lungs. Got it. Should I avoid exercise for now? Light activity like walking is fine as long as you don't push yourself too hard. Once your test results are back, we can discuss a pulmonary rehabilitation plan, a supervised exercise and breathing program that strengthens your lungs safely. Okay, that sounds good. Excellent. I'll also check your oxygen levels today and if needed, we might consider oxygen therapy later. But that depends entirely on your test results. Alright, so we'll confirm the diagnosis only after the spirometry and imaging test. In the meantime, use the inhaler as needed, drink plenty of fluids and avoid irritants. Thank you, Dr. You explained everything so clearly. You're welcome, Ms. Sharma. I'll have the nurse perform the spirometry now and we'll schedule you follow up with it in one week to go over the results. Sounds good. Thanks again. Take care and I'll see you soon.
