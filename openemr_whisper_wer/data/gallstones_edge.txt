Good morning. Please come and take a seat. What brings you in today?
Morning Doctor. I've been having this severe pain in the upper right part of my stomach.
Oh, okay. Can you point exactly to where you feel the pain?
Around here, just under my ribs.
Oh, okay. Got it. And how long have you been experiencing this?
It's been on and off for a few months, but in the past when the pain has become more frequent and much stronger.
When the pain comes, how would you describe it? Is it like sharp, dull or damp like?
Feels like a stabbing pain, sometimes like a tight squeeze and it radiates to my back at times.
Hmm, that's helpful. Okay, so on a scale of 1 to 10, how bad is it at its worst?
Around 9. It's almost an unbearable.
Oh, I can imagine that must be very uncomfortable.
Have you noticed whether anything triggers it or makes it worse?
Yes, definitely after meals, especially if the food is oily or heavy.
Oh, oily or heavy. Okay, got it. So, does anything...
Okay, so does anything relieve the pain?
Not really. I've tried some over-the-counter tablets for a gastric upset, but they don't seem to help.
Hmm, understood. So, have you had nausea, vomiting or fever with these episodes?
No fever. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous, but I haven't vomited.
Okay, got it. So, let me ask you.
Have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or has your urine turned darker than usual?
Now that you've mentioned it, my urine has looked darker lately.
I thought it was just because I wasn't drinking enough water.
Okay, so while we are talking, I'm noticing a slight...
Oh, yellowish tinge in your eyes. Have you noticed that yourself?
No, doctor. I didn't pay attention. But looking now, yes, I can see it.
Oh, that's a mild sign of jaundice. It can happen if a gallstone is blocking the bowel flow from the liver.
Oh, I see. I didn't know that.
Okay, many people think stomach pain after eating is just cash writers,
but cash writers' pain is usually in the upper middle part of the abdomen.
More like a burning sensation and often improves with some antacids.
Your pain is in the upper right side, radiating to the back,
words after fatty meals as you mentioned, and you've got some jaundice,
all of which point more toward gallstones rather than cash writers.
That makes sense now. Is it very serious?
Gallstones can cause complications if untreated, like affection of the gallbladder,
or the blockage of the bile ducts.
But the good news is, if you diagnose it early, it's very treatable.
Will I need surgery?
If gallstones are confirmed and your symptoms are severe,
the usual treatment is to remove the gallbladder surgically.
It's a common procedure, and most people recover well.
But first, we need to confirm the diagnosis.
Okay.
I'll order an abdominal ultrasound, which is the best test-redicted gallstones,
along with that. I want you to get some lactose, like liver function test,
to check how your liver is working and cholesterol profile,
since gallstones are often linked with cholesterol imbalance.
All right, doctor.
Before we finish, I want to check your records. I see you have hypertension.
So are you in medication and how is it controlled?
Yes, I am on medication and my blood pressure is stable.
Oh, good, good. So do you drink alcohol?
I used to drink heavily, but these days I still drink often,
but not as much as before.
Thank you for being honest.
Alcohol can strain the liver, so it's best to cut it down further,
especially with these symptoms.
I understand. I'll work on that.
Great. I'll also do a quick abdominal examination now.
Goodbye.
Oh, okay. So I can feel some tenderness in the upper right quadrant,
which matches with your symptoms.
The brain force is my suspicion of gallstones.
Okay.
For now, I would say avoid fatty, fried and oily foods.
They trigger a lot of contractions and worse in the pain.
I think you should stay hydrated and if the pain becomes unbearable
or if you develop fever, chills or vomiting,
you should come to the emergency room immediately.
Hi, Doctor. Thank you.
You're welcome. Let's get those tested and once we have the results,
we'll discuss the next steps together.
