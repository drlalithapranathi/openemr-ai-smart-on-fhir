Good morning. Please, woman will take a seat. What brings you in today? Morning, Doctor. I've been having this severe pain in the upper right part of my stomach. Oh, okay. Can you point exactly to where you feel the pain? Around here, just under my ribs. Oh, okay. Got it. And how long have you been experiencing this? Spine on and off for a few months. but in the past when the pain has become more frequent and much stronger. When the pain comes how would you describe it? Is it like sharp, dull or damp like? Feels like a stabbing pain, sometimes like a tight squeeze and it radiates to my back at times. hmm that's helpful okay so on a scale of 1 to 10 how bad is it at its worst? around 9 it's almost un-bearable., I can imagine that must be very uncomfortable. Have you noticed whether anything triggers it or makes it worse? Yes, definitely after meals, especially if the food is oily or heavy. Oh, oily or heavy. Okay, got it. So, does anything... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, understood. So have you had nausea, vomiting or fever with these episodes? No fever. Sometimes I feel a bit nauseous but I haven't vomited. Okay got it. So let me ask you, have you noticed any changes in your bowel habits or has your urine turned darker than usual? Now that you mention it, my urine has looked darker lately. I thought it was just because I wasn't drinking enough water. Hmm, oh. Okay, so while we are talking, I am noticing a slight. Oh, yellowish tinge in your eyes. Have you noticed that yourself? No, doctor. I didn't pay attention. But looking now, yes yes I can see it. Oh that's a mild sign of jaundice. It can happen if a gal stone is blocking the bile flow from the liver. Oh I see I didn't know that. Okay many people think stomach pain after eating is just cash writers, but cash writers pain is usually in the upper middle part of the abdomen. More like a burning sensation and often improves with some antacids. Your pain is in the upper right side, radiating to the back, worse after fatting heels as you mentioned and you have got some jaundice, of which point more toward girl stones rather than gas striders that makes sense now is it very serious girl stones can cause complications if untreated, like affection of the gallbladder or the brokerage of the bio-ducks. But the good news is, if you diagnose it early, it's very treatable. Will I need surgery? If gallstones are confirmed and your symptoms are severe, the usual treatment is to remove the gallbladder surgically. It's a common procedure and most people recover well. But first we need to confirm the diagnosis. Okay. I'll order an abdominal ultrasound which is the best test-redaditic I want you to get some black test like liver function test to check how your liver is working and cholesterol profile since the cholesterol is often linked with cholesterol imbalance Alright doctor Before we finish, I want to check your records I see you have hypertension So are you in medication and how is it controlled? Yes, I am on medication and I have a lot of problems I have been in medication and I have been in hypertension so are you in medication and how is it controlled yes I am on medication and my blood pressure is stable oh good good so do you drink alcohol I used to drink heavily but these days I still drunk often but not as much as before thank Thank you for being honest. Alcohol can strain the liver so it's best to cut it down further, especially with these symptoms. I understand. I'll work on that. Great. I also do work with abdominal examination now. Oh, okay, so I can feel some tenderness in the upper right quadrant which matches with your symptoms. The train force is my suspicion of calf storms. For now, I would say avoid fatty, fried and oily foods. They trigger wild blood on the tractions and worse in the pain. I think you should stay hydrated and if the pain becomes unbearable or if you develop fever, chills or vomiting, you should come to the emergency room immediately. Well, Doctor, thank you. You're welcome. Let's get those tests done and once we have the results we will discuss the next steps together.
